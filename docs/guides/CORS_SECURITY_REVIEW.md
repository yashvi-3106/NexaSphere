# CORS Security Policy Review

This document performs a security review of the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy implemented in NexaSphere.

## 1. CORS Policy Configuration

The backend Express application (`server/index.js`) configures CORS using the `cors` middleware with the following security constraints:

```javascript
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: (origin, callback) => {
      if (!origin) {
        return callback(null, true);
      }
      if (allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
        return callback(null, true);
      }
      return callback(new Error('CORS Policy: Origin not allowed.'));
    },
    credentials: true,
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With'],
    preflightContinue: false,
    optionsSuccessStatus: 204,
    maxAge: 86400, // 24 hours
  })
);
```

## 2. Threat Analysis & Security Controls

### 2.1 Wildcard Origin vs. Credentials

- **Vulnerability**: Utilizing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` is forbidden by the CORS specification and rejected by modern browsers. However, dynamically reflecting the incoming `Origin` header blindly is equivalent to a wildcard and exposes the application to CSRF/unauthorized data exposure.
- **Control**: Origin is matched strictly against a whitelisted array (`allowedOrigins`) populated via the `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable. Unmatched origins are rejected with an error, preventing reflection of malicious origins.

### 2.2 Preflight Requests & Caching

- **Efficiency & Security**: CORS preflight checks (`OPTIONS` requests) are automatically answered with a `204 No Content` status.
- **Control**: The `maxAge: 86400` header caches the preflight response for **24 hours**, minimizing additional latency and reducing preflight verification traffic to the backend server.

### 2.3 Restricting Methods & Headers

- **Control**: Only standard, safe HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`) and safe headers (`Content-Type`, `Authorization`, `X-Requested-With`) are accepted, restricting attackers from sending non-standard headers or utilizing unsafe HTTP methods.

## 3. Verification & Compliance

- **Automated Tests**: Handled by `server/test/cors.test.js` validating:
  1. Success and proper headers when whitelisted origin is passed.
  2. Blocking and error status when non-whitelisted/malicious origin is passed.
  3. Preflight configurations returning `204` with appropriate caching.
