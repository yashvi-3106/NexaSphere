## 10. Design Principles

All workflows follow these conventions:

| Principle                        | Implementation                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fork safety**                  | Use `pull_request_target` (not `pull_request`) so write token works for fork PRs  |
| **No code execution from forks** | We never `checkout` + `run` fork code in `pull_request_target` workflows          |
| **Idempotency**                  | Label helpers check for existence before create/add                               |
| **Bot exclusion**                | All workflows skip `[bot]` suffixed usernames                                     |
| **Admin exemption**              | `Ayushh-Sharmaa` and `S3DFX-CYBER` are exempt from strict contributor validations |
| **Concurrency**                  | Every workflow has a `concurrency` group to prevent duplicate runs                |
| **Minimum permissions**          | Each job declares only the permissions it needs                                   |
