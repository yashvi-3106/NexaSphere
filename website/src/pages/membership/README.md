## Duplicate Submission Guard

To prevent the same device from submitting twice, the submitted WhatsApp number is stored in `localStorage` under `ns_member_emails`. On mount, the form checks this key and shows a warning if an entry exists.

This is a **device-level** guard only — it does not prevent submissions from different devices with the same number.

---

## Success Screen

After submission, the user sees:

- ✅ Confirmation message
- 🔗 Button to join the NexaSphere WhatsApp Group
- 💼 Button to follow NexaSphere on LinkedIn
- 📌 Reminder to mention "I have already filled the NexaSphere form" when requesting to join the WhatsApp group

## To Update the Apps Script URL

If you redeploy the Apps Script and get a new URL:

```js
// MembershipPage.jsx — line ~33
const MEMBERSHIP_SCRIPT_URL = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/<NEW_ID>/exec';
```
