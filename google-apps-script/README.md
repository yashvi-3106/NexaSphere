# ⚙️ google-apps-script/

Google Apps Script source files. These are **not bundled by Vite** — they must be manually copied into the Apps Script editor at [script.google.com](https://script.google.com).

## Files

| File | Purpose | Apps Script Project |
|---|---|---|
| `Code.gs` | **Membership Form** handler — writes to Google Sheets | "NexaSphere Membership" |

> The **Core Team Recruitment** form uses a separate Apps Script project (not stored in this folder).

---

## Code.gs — Membership Form

Receives a `POST` request from `MembershipPage.jsx` and appends a row to the `Membership` tab in the linked Google Sheet.

## How to redeploy after editing Code.gs

1. Open the Apps Script project → paste the updated `Code.gs`
2. **Deploy → Manage deployments → Edit (pencil icon) → New version → Deploy**
3. The **Deployment ID and URL stay the same** when you edit an existing deployment — no code change needed in the frontend
4. If you create a **New deployment** instead, a new URL is generated — update `MEMBERSHIP_SCRIPT_URL` in `MembershipPage.jsx`

## CORS note

Google Apps Script does not support CORS preflight for `application/json`. The frontend sends requests with:

```js
fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  mode: 'no-cors',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' },   // ← must be text/plain
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
})
```

The script receives the raw text in `e.postData.contents` and parses it as JSON. The response is opaque (no response body visible to the browser) — this is expected and correct behaviour.
