## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Publicly disclosing a vulnerability before it is fixed puts the entire user community at risk.

### How to Report

Contact the maintainers privately through one of these channels:

| Contact       | Handle                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Project Admin | [@S3DFX-CYBER](https://github.com/S3DFX-CYBER)       |
| Mentor        | [@Ayushh-Sharmaa](https://github.com/Ayushh-Sharmaa) |

Send a direct message on GitHub or reach out via the GSSoC Discord (project channel) with the subject line: **[SECURITY] NexaSphere — Vulnerability Report**.

### What to Include

Please provide as much of the following as possible:

- **Description** — A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- **Affected component** — Frontend, backend API, database layer, authentication, etc.
- **Steps to reproduce** — A minimal proof-of-concept or step-by-step instructions
- **Environment** — Browser/OS/Node.js version if relevant
- **Suggested fix** — Any potential mitigations or patches you are aware of

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing code, please keep these in mind:

- **Never commit secrets** — no API keys, passwords, or tokens in code (use `.env` files)
- **Validate all inputs** — use Zod schemas on the backend for every external input
- **Keep dependencies updated** — run `npm audit` and address high/critical advisories
- **Follow least-privilege** — request only the permissions your code needs
- **Use parameterised queries** — never concatenate user input into SQL strings
